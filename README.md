# iFont - Collection of most loved Apple made fonts.

iFont is a huge collection of Apple San-Francisco and the new New-York font directly ported from Apple Developer Website (https://developer.apple.com/fonts)
iFont will get updated instantly when there's a new change to the font. This package only includes basic text fonts in OTF (Open Type) but, in future it will 
have other things like SF Symbols, Nanum Gothic, etc.
This project/repository might get taked down by apple but, if it actually DOES get took down, i'll post a tweek on my twitter that includes link to the same files
possibaly in Cloud service/GitHub Alternatives/NAS.
